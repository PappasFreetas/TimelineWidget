# TimelineJS Widget

See [AppStoreWidgetBoilerplate](https://github.com/mendix/AppStoreWidgetBoilerplate/) for an example

This widget needs a google sheet as an input - follow instructions at https://timeline.knightlab.com/#make 

To test you can paste https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_aWNKZPwqxeIzNgjgfBmt2ikHYTNwM7Frrfchij4C_I/edit#gid=0 into the widget GUI in Mendix.

In the widget GUI you can select advanced mode and then put JSON config options. If you select basic mode then the config options will be ignored.
